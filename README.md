These are some mathematica code used in my graduate numerical analysis class. 

In particular, this notebook (Finite_Difference) runs some simple finite difference methods for first-order wave equations.
by implementing the first forward, first backward, second central, and Crank Nicolson methods. 

The other notebook (curve-fitting) performs various interpolation and approximation methods
such as linear, quadratic, cubic, and B-spline.
